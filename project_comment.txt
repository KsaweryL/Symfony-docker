this project uses dymfony and docker to create simple form

it works well, time to move to the db project (symfony-docker-6) which will be a copy of this one with the addition of database

//update 01.08.2023
when hitting docker compose ps dockerized_sf_project-fpm-1 is clearly running, but for docker compose exec is clearly doesn't lmaoooo

it turned out we shouldn't use compose with exec command...
Nevertheless, the database is connected with the web page and it works great!
I do have however one database too many and getting rid of it seems to be more complicated than I thought

//update 01.08.2023
the inclusion of database seems to be working corectly, now let's try to create a new project that will only use 1 database container (symfony-docker-6)

//update 01.08.2023
I managed to find a way to stop using one of the database containers without breaking the whole program

//update currently working on this one...

//update 03.08.2023
UserDataSqlController contains routes for the main databse, rest of projects are either unfinished or made purely
for testing some features

//update 03.08.2023
